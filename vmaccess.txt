sudo bash
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/wlan0/proxy_arp
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o wlan0 -j MASQUERADE 


It worked last time with the above setting, it's NAT not route or ip forward.

You need to assign a floating IP to the VMs you create if you want a host from outside the openstack network to connect to it. The internal IPs are only accessible from inside the openstack network.

See how to assign a floating IP to a VM here: http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/content/floating_ip_allocate.html

To access the VM's floating IP from another host (that is not the devstack host) you should make sure that the devstack host is configured to forward packets. You can do this with:

sudo bash
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/eth0/proxy_arp
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE 
See more details here: http://barakme.tumblr.com/post/70895539608/openstack-in-a-box-setting-up-devstack-havana-on-your

floating address can be checked, created, deleted by nova-manage floating
nova-manage floating list
nova-manage floating create --pool public --ip_range 192.168.1.230/28 --interface wlan0/br100
nova-manage floating delete 192.168.1.230/28

change /etc/nova/nova.conf public_interface=br100 to wlan0 ???

stack.sh has a floating ip range, default to 172.x.x.x, change it to the right 
range before ./stack.sh

~/devstack source openrc to access nova command.
